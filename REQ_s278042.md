## Abstract
EZGas is an application-based crowdsourcing service that allows users all over the world to locate gas stations in different areas, along with the types of fuels and respective prices for each gas station.
Moreover users are allowed to add further services provided at the gas station (eg. Bar, Shop, Mechanic, Car Wash, etc. )

## Stakeholders
| Stakeholder | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Developer | In charge of building the application |
| Buyer | Commission the developer and pays for the system
| Administrator | Manages the gas stations list by editing or removing wrong information 
| User | Unregistered customers are able only to see app content (profile 1)
| User | Registered customers are able to add or update information on gas stations (profile 2)

## Context Diagram and Interfaces

### Context Diagram
```plantuml

```
### Interfaces
| Actor | Logical Interface | Physical Interface  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-----:|
| User | App or WebApp GUI |Screen, keyboard|
| Map System | API | Internet |

## Stories and personas
User Mario wants to be able to individually look out for gas stations location, as well as their prices or services. He should be able to provide detail for each of his needs and matching gas station need to be highlighted in his application.

User Luigi is in a hurry and needs to find the closest possible gas station which has fuel compatible with his vehicle. The application should be able to find the best-fit for his needs in a fast way, as well as providing the needed instruction to reach the gas stations.

User Todd is on a budget and consistently needs to find the cheapest alternative available, for this reason the app should be constantly updated after each user submission. Moreover user preferences should be saved in the client application.

## Functional Requirements

| FR1     | Record that a gas station has fuel of a certain type |  
| FR2     | Record that a gas station charges x euros per liter for a certain type of fuel |
| FR3     | Record that a gas station is at a specific location |
| FR4     | Record opening days and hours for each gas station, as well as if you can refill on your own |
| FR5     | Record other services available at each gas station |
| FR6     | Produce a report about all updates to prices in time, for each gas station|
| FR7     | Manage user CRUD operations |
| FR8     | Manage a list of submissions for each user |
| FR9   | Get access to a users current location

### Use Cases

#### Use case 1, UC1 - FR2  Record prices by fuel
| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Gas station GS exists, with fuel type F | 
|  Post condition     | F.price_pre != F.price_now |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User inputs updated price for fuel F at gas station GS, app records user submission and updates record|
|  Variants     | User input not withing predefined fuel price range |

| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Gas station GS exists | 
|  Nominal Scenario     | User inputs location for gas station GS, app records user submission and updates record|
|  Variants     | User input not recognized by map services API |

#### Use case 3, UC3 - FR5  Record other services
| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Gas station GS exists | 
|  Nominal Scenario     | User inputs additional services for gas station GS, app records user submission and updates record|
|  Variants     | User input not within predefined options |

#### Use case 4, UC4 - FR7 Manage user CRUD operation
| Actors Involved        | Administrator |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Guest user exists, new account needed |  
|  Nominal Scenario     | Administrator confirms user account credentials|
