# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:

- collect prices of fuels in different gas stations
- locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice

<!--Some colleagues share a coffee machine in a common space for breaks. Capsules are left aside the machine. Whoever uses a capsule writes this down in a notebook left aside the coffee machine. One of the colleagues (called *administrator*) copies consumptions in an excel sheet and collects money from colleagues to (re)order capsules.

One of the colleagues, the *hacker*, volunteers to develop a simple application to support the administrator. To keep things simple the application is standalone, and is meant to be used only by the administrator. Possibly the administrator role is taken by different colleagues over time. Instead of the notebook, the hacker sets up a WhatsApp group. Whenever a colleague uses a capsule, he sends a message to the group.-->


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name     | Description | 
| -------------------- |:-----------:|
| Developers           | Develop and maintain the application. They want the application to be popular and used. May also use the application. They would like it not to be too complex while being very useful and accurate. |
| Administrators       | Are responsible for the correct operation of the application and for data and contents in it. They handle reports from users and public about the content and the behaviour of the application.
| Users                | Use the application to find the best prices among the gas stations nearby. May contribute inserting or updating gas stations and prices. |
| Gas stations' owners | Do not necessarily use the application directly. They are interested in attract as many drivers as they can. |

# Stories and personas
_Marshall_ drives his car back and forth to work from monday to friday. The commute is long enough to pass close to different gas stations. Marshall tries to pay attention to the signs advertising the prices to then remember which gas station was the cheapest, but that requires quite some effort and memory. He often forgets which was the cheapest station or even to look the price signs of some stations. In this way Marshall usually ends up making a sub-optimal choice when stopping to fuel his car, ending up paying more. Marshall wants to cut commute costs in a more effortlessly way.

By using EZGas Marshall could check on his phone, before leaving his house or before leaving the office, which is the cheapest gas station on is commute, no need to look for the price signs, and he would need to remember only at which station to stop.
Marshall is going to be more relaxed while driving and is going to save a significant amount of money over time.

_Ted_ does not commute daily by car, he prefers to move around by bike. In the weekend or during holidays he enjoys car trips around the country to the most unlikely destinations with his wife Tracy and their children. Before leaving town he likes to stop to a gas station to avoid to pay more stopping at the usually much more expensive gas stations on the highway. His family instead always wants to hit the road as soon as possible and Ted ends up having to stop at gas stations on the highway.

Using EZGas Ted can check ahead where are the cheapest gas stations along the road and can try to insert some small deviations to save some money.

_Robin_ drives her motorbike all around the city every night, working for a food delivery company. Every cent she and her colleagues can save is important to make their work really profitable. She likes to share which is the cheapest gas station she sees with her colleagues and they do the same with her, this usually happens when they meet or with messages on their instant messaging groups' chats. But chats get really messy and it's difficult to understand which is the best price and where to find it.

Robin already use her phone for directions, with EZGas she can check and update prices for the gas stations she stops to and more easily share them with her colleagues.

_Barney_ works in a gas station, to have more clients he updates the prices on EZGas any time he lowers them on the signs.

_Lily_ works for EZGas and will handle reports from the users and the public about the contents and the application behaviours. She works from home to spend more time with her childrens. She uses her own laptop to work and needs a simple yet powerful interface to the application, through a web browser, to receive all the reports in one place and perform the adeguate changes to the contents of the application as fast as possible. Through this intergace using her account she can deactivate the accounts of users who misbehave. She collects technical reports and when necessary forwards them in batches to the developers via email.
