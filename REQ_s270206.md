# Abstract

Nowadays the price of fuel per liter varies widely from gas station to an other. In fact, once the most convenient station is found, drivers no longer tend to change it, even if the price become no more convenient. 

A team of software developers has come up with a way to facilitate the search for the nearest and most convenient gas station. 
EZGas was born from this idea, in fact it is a crowdsourcing service that allows drivers to collect prices of fuels in different gas stations and locate them in an area, along with the prices they practice.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name           | Description | 
| -------------------------- |:-----------:|
| Driver 	                 |He/She uses the application to locate nearest gas stations and to insert or update gas price information| 
| Gas Stations Managers      |They are interested in being always up to date to the price of competitors in the same area| 
| EZGas Developers			 |They are responsible for any issue and have to monitor user experience to prevent problems and improve the system|

# Stories and personas

Marco is a businessman living in Rome. His job forces him to drive around the city all day with his car and he has often to refuel. Thanks to EZGas, he is always able to find a closer and convenient gas station, without having to remember the price of the various stations every time. While refueling, he checks if the price on the application is updated and if it isn't, he updates it.

Julia is on vacation in Rome. During these days she decides to take a rental car to visit the city. Since she doesn't know the city and is afraid of wasting too much time and money looking for gas stations, she searches on EZGas for those that were most comfortable to reach, comparing the prices they practice. Fortunately, she immediately finds a very convenient station, thanks to Marco who have just updated the price.

George is gas station manager in London and he was really worried for his job becouse his activity was not very known in his area. He found EZGas and by seeing the nearby stations, finally realized that he should lower the price to be more competitive. Now in George's gas station there are many customers queuing to refuel and he is always up to date to the price of competitors in his area.
