# Abstract

The EZGas application is a software to help people easily find gas stations on a map, also informing them of their respective prices.
The manager of the gas station is in charge to upload and modify prices when necessary, while an administrator is in charge to check these prices and update them on the app.
The software relies on Google Maps for the position of the stations.

# Stories and personas

Jack is the manager of the gas station. He keep updated the price of the fuel in his gas station, basing the sale price on the purchase price from its supplier. The price changes when Jack receives an order from the gas supplier, more or less every 4-5 days.

Gas can be purchased between a minimum and a maximum quantity.
Jack send the new price to John with the amount of liters of gas available for each type.

John is an administrator and operates the change of prices. Each time a manager send him a new price, he checks its range and if it's too low or too high with respect to other stations, send a warning message.

Mike is a guy who needs to refuel gas for his car and he decides to use EZgas application. When Mike enters the app he is asked what is the radius in which he wants to search the stations.
The Google Maps software is used to locate gas stations. If Mike needs it, he can directly set the google maps navigator to reach the chosen station.
