# Abstract

Many drivers in the world would like to know prices of fuels in advance before going to a gas station, so they can choose the cheaper. Other want to know simply the closer to their position, so a map is needed.

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to collect prices of fuels in different gas stations and locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| Users | Use the system to search gas stations and update their price |
| Map System | It can be used to show gas stations on a map |
| GPS System | It can be used to locate the user's location |
| Administrator | Manages user accounts |

## Interfaces

| Actor | Logical Interface | Physical Interface |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|
| User | GUI | Screen, touchscreen, keyboard, mouse |
| Map system | API | Internet |
| GPS system | API | GPS satellites |

# Stories and personas

Charlie is a **truck driver** who does not care about the price but would like to find the gas stations easily, in order to organize his journey.

Oscar is a **father** of three children, he would like to find the nearest and cheapest stations. It would be important to him that the prices are updated recently, so he could also update them.

Mike is a **tourist**, he recently arrived in a city and would like to find gas stations. It is important for him that the application is easy to use, he does not want to take time to learn its functions.

Jack is the **administrator**, he monitors inappropriate account use and possible attacks on the system

## Non Functional Requirements

| ID        | Type (efficiency, reliability, .. see iso 9126) | Description | Refers to |

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1 Search for nearest gas stations
| Actors Involved | User, Map system, GPS system |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Precondition | There is at least 1 gas station near the user |
| Post condition | The user has found the gas station of interest |
| Nominal Scenario | User sends his position, he navigates through the map and looks at the prices |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Set or update the fuel prices of a gas station
| Actors Involved | Registered user |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Precondition | User is authenticated and the gas station of interest is valid |
| Post condition | Price has been set or updated |
| Nominal Scenario | User finds a gas station, he clicks "edit" and writes the cost of fuel |
| Variants | Some error due to invalid value input |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3 View the fuel prices of a gas station on the map
| Actors Involved | User, Map system |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Precondition | The gas station of interest is valid |
| Post condition | The user has found the fuel price of interest |
| Nominal Scenario | User finds a gas station, he clicks "view" and reads the cost of fuel |
| Variants | There may be no price |

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR4 Manage registered users and guests
| Actors Involved | Administrator |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Precondition | The system works |
| Post condition | Any action does not affect the fuel price of the gas stations |
| Nominal Scenario | Administrator can create and delete users |
