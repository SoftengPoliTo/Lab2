# Stories and personas
Andy is the administrator of the EZGas app. He can manage the different gas stations' changes proposed by users. He opens the app and accept or decline changes. All the changes are uploaded into the system.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1  Display gas stations locations

| Actors Involved        | User, Database, Google Maps |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Database should contains gas station list |  
|  Post condition     | Gas stations have to be displayed on the map |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User select to open the map. EZGas query the DB to receive the list of gas station in the area of the user. EZGas uses Google API to display the locations|
|  Variants     | Lost of connection. There are not gas stations near the user |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2  Manage gas station creation

| Actors Involved        | Registered user, Administrator, Database |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Registered user has to be logged in |  
|  Post condition     | Database updated |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User compile the form to send a new request for a new gas station. Administrator evaluates the request and decide to accept or decline it. If the request is accepted the database is updated|
|  Variants     | If the request is declined ther is not database update|

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3  Provide directions to reach the gas station

| Actors Involved        | User, Google Maps |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     |  |  
|  Post condition     |  |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User select a gas station on the map and asks for direction. Google Maps provides directions. |
|  Variants     | Lost connection|

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR4  Manage user account

| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     |  |  
|  Post condition     | Database updated |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User decide to create a new account to use the EZGas application. He compiles the form and submit it to the system. The system create a new account. If the user decides to delete his account, he can do it in his account manager section and the system deletes the account.|
|  Variants     | Lost connection|
