# Abstract

*Gas station* positions are very important for *drivers*, expecially for who travels a lot for his/her job. Finding a gas station can be an expensive time activity and depends on each single person preferences.

Gas station owners are very interested to increase their visibility, in particular those one who does not provide their service on a main and busy road. They can try to make their own advertisements, but a specific system for gas stations can be more effective.

The *EZGas application* goal is to provide an uniform interface between drivers and gas station owners. As different people have different ways to choose with gas station use, many metrics will be implemented to allow multiple configurations.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| :- | :-: |
| User | Uses the application to find a gas station, according to predefined or configurable metrics |
| Authenticated user | Is able to do more actions than a non authenticated user: insert car data, configure more search metrics, review gas stations |
| Gas station owner | Owns the gas station, after he/she register to the system can set the price for each selled fuel |
| Administrator | Manages users data (user accounts, feedbacks, comments, analytics) and gas station oweners data (registration, validation) |
| Web API | To show maps, driving routes, send user requests and data to the app servers |

# Stories and personas

Giacomo travels a lot for his work. When he has to fill his car he wants to find the nearest gas station. Furthermore he does not like to configure apps before using them - he prefers fast and easy solutions.

Enrico always pays a lot of attention to save money. When he has to fill his car he chooses the cheapest and nearest gas station very carefully. He thinks an automated app on his smartphone can be very useful for people like him.

Elisabetta hates waiting for gas station queues. She would like to predict which gas stations are the most used in a specific hour of the day.

Carlo owns a gas station in a secondary street. Even if he keeps low prices, he cannot increase his customers because few traffic is there. He would like a new system to increase his visibility to drivers.

# GUI prototype

The graphic user interface prototype has been build for the smallest device which can be used, a smartphone, as it usually is the most difficult graphic interface to desing.

All the following pictures can be seen on https://drive.google.com/open?id=14kPBRewnpwm0uIk67zV_6DXdY3h5qw6Y.

## Log in

This log in prototype is the same for Authenticated User, Gas station owner and Administrator.

## Leave a comment and a vote

When the user reaches the gas station he/she has previously selected, a comment field automatically is shown.

## Manage default settings

The default search type is the search type automatically used when the app is opened.

## Gas station owner homepage

A Gas station owner can own more than one gas station. When he/she opens the app, if more than one gas station is related to him/her, he/she has to select which gas station wants to manage.
