# Abstract
Nowadays it often happens for the average car driver to go and seek for the most convenient gas station nearby when refueling is needed.
He might stick to the one he thinks is the best in terms of price and distance, but he would need to periodically check his area for price changes in the other stations, relatively to the one he chose.

That's why our brand new startup decided to develop a service which could help the drivers to find the most convenient gas station in their area when they need it.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Guest User | Searches for a gas station | 
| Registered User | Searches for a gas station and/or inserts/updates them | 
| OpenStreetMaps | Provides maps API and service |

# Stories and personas
Mark is a regular car driver and when he needs to buy fuel for his car he can drive even for a whole kilometer looking for the gas station with the lowest price in the way. Though he often ends up losing a good bit of the money he saved for searching the station. Though with _EZGas_ he can easily find the best compromise every time he needs to refill!

Barbra instead uses to always refill to the same gas station, which has really low prices, but many times there have been better alternatives in her area! With _EZGas_ now she can find out which is the closest dealer with the lowest price.

Jack is driving on the highway and he will need to refuel soon, so when he reaches for the next service area he looks on _EZGas_ if such service area is convenient or there are better alternatives further on the route, but before the fuel runs too low! At the same time, he finds out the price in _EZGas_ for the gas station (in the service area he's currently in) isn't up-to-date, so he proceeds to send an update.
