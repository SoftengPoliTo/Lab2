# Abstract
A group of friends are used to travel almost every day because of their job and because during the weekend they spend time with their family and friends doing sightseeing and walking in the nature and so on. They have a Whatsapp group in which they signal to the others the prices of the Gas station in which they fuel up, so that the other members of the group can refuel in the station with the lower price.

Since the more people there are in the group, the more price reports there are, it could be possible to have the price of all the gas stations in the city, in this way, it is much more likely to refuel in the gas station with the lower price in the city. However, doing it with a Whatsapp group would be a mess, either because there would be too much messages and finding the lower prices among them would be really difficult, moreover people who are interested to this kind of service are not able to freely join the group. That’s why some member of this group, who are employers in an IT company, decided to set up a mobile crowdsourcing application, which could allow the users to collect the price of the gas stations, and to find, among them the one which is closer and with the lower prices. 

Since anyone could be able to change the prices, all the modifications provided by the end users, have to be inspected by a group of moderators. 
The gas station owners are able to provide some proof in order to take the control of the price list of their gas station, all the modifications provided by an owner are automatically approved, moreover the owner is able to accept or reject the modifications provided by the other users for their gas station.

# Stories and personas
Mario is a washing machine technician, he goes around the city with his van all the day and he need to fuel up in average two times a week. He refuel in the early morning before going to work, in order to be sure that he won’t have any problem during the day. He prefers to fuel up in a gas station which is close to the house of the first customer of the day so he won’t be late.
He would like to have a way for looking up to the customer’s address and finding the closest gas station with the lower price, but he is really good with the washing machines but not so good in using the smartphone.

Hannah is as traveller, she goes around the world with her camper with her husband Gimmy. They don’t have so much money to spend for fueling up and since they usually don’t know the places in which they stay, they need a way for finding the closest gas station for refueling without spending too much.

Bob is 24, he loves to travel with his girlfriend and friends, and when he visit a place he typically leaves a review of that place, that’s because he really likes to share his experience and to suggest to the other people of the community the place which he prefers. Bob would be really happy to update the price list of EZGas, so that he can always find the gas station with the lower price when he is around, but he can also help the other people thanks to his contributes.  

Gianni bought his gas station two years ago, he though it was a really good deal, but unfortunately it wasn’t. He hasn’t many customers, because people don’t know about Gianni’s gas station, because it isn’t in the main road. Gianni would like something which could allow him to let people know about his gas station and about his competitive prices.
