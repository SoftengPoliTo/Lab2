## Abstract

A guy from Genoa moves to Turin to study at Politecnico. Loving to go around the city he brings his motorcycle with him. After some days in Turin he needs to fill up the tank of his bike but, not being used to the new city, he doesn't know where to find a gas station. Being from Genoa, he wants to spend as little as possible for gas money, so he can't use some basic maps application not providing prices for fuel. Being a Computer Engineer student he decides to create an app to help him and all other peole.

In order to use the app a user needs to register through an external IDP (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc...). The app is based on crowdsourcing, so every user needs to be an active part in the system. A user can see all the gas stations in the app. A user can add the prices for a gas station accompained by a picture of the pricing table. A user can see the an average of pricetables posted by other users. In a single day a user is limited to know info about price of X gas stations at maximum, where X is the number of gas stations s/he updated in the last 3 days. This is based on the assumption that fuel prices usually don't change overnight.

## Stories and personas

John needs to take a 45 to 60 minutes car dive to work everyday because his workplace is in another city. He doesn't know the prices of the gas stations close to his workplace so, when he runs short on fuel, he always needs to fill up his car close to his home. John knows pretty well the prices of the gas stations around his home because he passes near them every time he goes for a walk with his dog or goes food shopping. One day he discovers EZGaz and starts sharing it with his friends and colleagues. Every time he comes nearby a station he takes a picture of its prices and updates them on the app. This way he will be useful to other peole for the stations close to his home and , more importantly, will be able to see prices of those stations close to his workplace. This way he doesn't need to worry about fuel first thing in the morning.

John is also very happy because the app doesn't require him to add another account to his email but he can directly login using the provider he prefers, varying from Google, Facebook, Github and others.
