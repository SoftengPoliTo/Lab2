# Abstract

The idea is to develop a crowdsourcing application, called EZGas, whose goal is to provide to users a service. This service consists in:
* search for gas stations that provide a particular kind of fuel in a ceirtain area
* visualizing them on a map, with their prices so that the user can decide, basing on prices and distances, the one to choose to get the gas.

There are basically two groups of people who will use the application. There are the **users**, that can be divided into *Registered* and *Unregistered*; the difference is that for the first ones, the search history and their informations (living and/or working area, kinds of fuels preferred ) will be recorded in order to provide a better service. Then ther are the **gas stations' owners** that will interact with the application by inserting their informations (location, kinds of fuels, prices) and updating them in real time.


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
|Users|They directly use the application, by searching for the gas stations that have the needed kind of fuel and finding them on a map| 
|Gas stations' owners|He or she interacts with the application in order to insert and update his data (fuel prices)|
|Developer|The one who develop the application, he or she has to make the application the easiest as possible so that many users will use it, and many gas organizations will be interested|
|DB Administrator|Manages the DB that records data of gas stations in order to provide the service the application is developed for|

## Functional Requirements

| ID        | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  FR1     | Manage gas stations research by using area (took from phone's GPS or not) and fuel type (optional) |  
|  FR2     | Manage gas stations visualization in the nearest area along with fuel prices |
|  FR3     | Manage visualization of the best route along with the distance of the selected gas station|
|  FR4     | Manage *Registered* users' accounts |
|  FR5     | Manage kind of fuels and prices changes |
|  FR6	   | Record gas stations' position |
|  FR7     | Manage gas stations' owners and their accounts |

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1 gas stations research 
| Actors Involved  | Maps system, User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | the area of serearch is valid (the city exists, and, if prompted, the address exists) |  
|  Post condition     | a list of possible gas stations with positions and prices |
|  Nominal Scenario   | the user selects an area and optionally a kind of fuel, the applications retrieve a list of gas stations that have that kind of fuel with prices and that are in the province of the selected city, then the application filters the result to find the ones that are in an area of 5 km around the address selected (if selected) throug the Maps system' APIs |
|  Variants     |  the area can be selected by using GPS, by inserting a city (with or without an address), by selecting from the list of frequent searches (for *Registered* users only)|

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 gas stations visualization

| Actors Involved  | Maps system |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|Pre condition| the list of gas stations must not be empty|
|Post condition| visualization of that list|
|Nominal Scenario| the Maps system, through some APIs, visualize the selected gas stations with their prices |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3 visualization of best route

| Actors Involved  | Maps system, User|
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|Pre condition| the user has selected on the map one gas station |
|Post condition| visualization of best route|
|Nominal Scenario| if inserted, the best route is retrieved thorough the Maps system's APIs and visualized with distance and percurrence time|
|Variants| if the user didn't inserted the address, a default one is used, retrieved from the Maps system (city center adress)|

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR5 edit fuels' prices
| Actors Involved  | Gas station's owner|
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|Pre condition| the owner must have an account|
|Post condition| F.price = new_price |
|Nominal Scenario| the owner selects a fuel F, update its F.price from old_price to new_price |
|Variants|the owner may add a new fuel and then insert the price|
