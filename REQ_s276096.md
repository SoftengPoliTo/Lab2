# Abstract

During a trip, **drivers** may need to re-fuel their car.
They look for the gas stations near by, with their relative informations like prices, location, ecc..

A **Gas Station Manager** wants to advertise his activity, so travellers will know where his station is and what prices he applies.

The EZGas developer created a service that collects the prices of the gas stations and locates them, that supports users.
They also developed an application that shows a list of the gas stations, sorting them by distance.
To keep things simple the application is standalone.
In order to provide a better service the application can use the GPS location to acquire a more precise location and gather customized results.


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name    | Description |
| -----------------   |:-----------:|
|Driver (registered)  |Uses the application to look for gas station informations (prices, location, ...) and can also indicate a new gas station if he founds a new one, along with the prices it practice and its location|
|Driver (unregistered)|Uses the application to look for gas station informations (prices, location, ...)|
|Gas station manager  |Uses the application to set his own gas station informations (prices, location, ...)|
|EZGas developer      |Their interests are user experience and application's informations, such as bugs, crashes, ecc...|
|Administrator        |CEO of EZGas|
|Buyer			          |It can a company that wants to implement the EZGas in its system or the user himself (if the application is not free-to-use)|
|Map service					|Service to display on the map the gas stations in both static way and dinamic way acoording to the GPS position of the user|

# Stories and personas
Paul is a well-known freelancer who travels a lot through the world because of his job.
Since he mostly travel by car, he'd like to know about the gas station he will found on the road during his trips.
When Paul travels, he has to pay for his own gas so he would like to know how many gas stations he will find on the road and what prices they apply to gas, so he can make wise decision about re-fuel in order to save money.

Luke is a Taxi driver in New York and likes to listen to his passengers stories, while driving them to their destinations.
In order to provide an excelent service he must be sure that he has enough gas to complete a ride, so it is fundamental to him knowing where are the nearest gas stations and their prices, to make re-fuel without spending to much and come back to work again.

John is a gas station manager. He wants to advertise his activity to everyone about his location and his prices, in order to become the best gas station manager in the country.
