# Abstract

EzGas is an application that aims to offer a crowdsourcing service, allowing users to take advantage of different information regarding different gas stations. Through this application users after registering have the possibility both to consult and to modify the information regarding gas stations updated by other users of the application. Using this application each user is able to know the prices and the different types of fuels that are offered by the different gas stations but also the services they can enjoy during the stop. By offering many freedoms to users, the system is controlled by an administrator, in case of incorrect behavior, users can send reports so that the administrator can provide a solution.

# Stakeholders

# Stories and personas
 
Josh is a family man, he has a precarious job. Every morning he wakes up early to go to work. He would like to use the bicycle to save the price of fuel, but unfortunately the company he works for is very far from his home. The gas station in which he is used to going has recently raised prices, despite being aware of this he does not know others stations where to go. He would like to have a simple way to find which gas station offers the fuel at a lower price.
 
Mark is a carefree boy. He works in the family business. He loves driving sports cars and recently bought one. His girlfriend lives several hundred kilometers away from him. Mark takes the car every weekend to get there and spend time with her. He would be interested in having an easy way to find out the nearest petrol station, whenever the petrol is running so as to stop only when necessary.
 
Luke is a manager of a company, he often travels with his company car. Since he does not pay for fuel directly, he is not so interested in the price of this. The trips he makes can be very long and he is therefore interested in finding welcoming rest areas that can offer him good coffee and good service.
 
Anna is a young girl who cares about the environment and is very worried about the increase of the pollution. She works in a company outside the city where she lives so she cannot use public transport to go to work and not even other green solutions. She would like to buy an electric car but her salary won't allow her. For this reason, she decided to buy a natural gas city car that consumes and pollutes little. Unfortunately, there are very few refueling stations that offer this fuel and reluctantly have to use petrol when facing longer journeys. She would like to find a way to find natural gas stations close to where she is and organize trips, being sure that she can always find this type of supply.

# Glossary

Here are described the key parts and concepts in the case considered. 

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/22CLOGgl38wCCEMl7ICVKMprnOCHv4AimLSQRlVgoPYa8RfnyghJDaK50lqLrY_yq7PeTSDkmQvnFRZ_QboQzbNK2zvDKSvXGhT0TCuWR3sip4O15K4FiUKBuKs_lWxCs933UIq4)

As described in the abstract of the document, each user of the application, called Driver, to use the features offered by EzGas must first register by deciding on a username and password. Within EzGas application, the user can perform three main operations:

**Gas station management** -> which includes the addition of a new station, modification of the station and cancellation of the gas station if it no longer exists.
The modification of the station parameters includes updating some information such as: payment method, opening hours, the types of fuel available and the relative prices and the services offered, defined through a briefly description and type.

**Search for one or more gas stations** -> this consists of different types of searches that can be carried out: Search by geographical area, search by type of payment, search by price and type of fuel.

**Report incorrect users** -> a user through this feature is able to report other users who have changed information with incorrect values.

The term gas station refers not only to the area of petrol pumps but also ,if present, to the surrounding areas, such as for example dining areas or other spaces. Each gas station consists of different information such as: type of payment accepted, type and description of the service offered and type and price of the different fuels available.

Once the system manager has accessed the system, he has the possibility to access the function called ***User management*** which consists in receiving information about the various users who have received reports in the application and being able to view the incorrect changes applied. In this way it is possible to maintain a consistent state of the information offered by EzGas and punish users who do not behave correctly.
