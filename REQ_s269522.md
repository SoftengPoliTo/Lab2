# Abstract

A car driver is driving along the streets of its city, when he notices that the fuel level of its machine has a low value, he wants to get gas without spend too much.
With the help of EZGas (a useful crowdsource application) the car driver can see the best choice for its goal seeing also the closest to him.

At the same time the owners of the gas stations can offer their prices and their special offers (presence of Autogrill or restaurants) through the same application locating also their gas station.
After getting gas the car driver writes also its personal review in order to improve the service given by the app.
