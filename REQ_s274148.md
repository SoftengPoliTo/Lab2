# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:
* collect prices of fuels in different gas stations
* locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Administrator     |Check data correctness| 
| Customer        |They are interested in gas stations data and they generate the data| 

# Context Diagram and interfaces

## Interfaces
| Actor | Logical Interface | Physical Interface  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|Administrator|GUI |Screen, keyboard, Internet connection|
|Customer|GUI |Screen, keyboard, Internet connection|


# Stories and personas
Customers need to find the nearest gas station with the lowest price.
Customers help each other sharing prices offered by gas stations they are in.

Administrator wants to check data inserted by customers is reliable,
before making it available to other users.

# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

| ID        | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  FR1     | Share current gas station fuel price |  
|  FR2     | Set search filters such as distance and price |
|  FR3     | Fetch gas stations locations and their current prices satisfying search filters |
|  FR4     | Find current location |
|  FR5     | Review data inserted by customers |

## Non Functional Requirements

| ID        | Type (efficiency, reliability, .. see iso 9126)           | Description  | Refers to |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| -----:|
|  NFR1     | Usability | Application should be used with no training by customers  | FR1-3 |
|  NFR2     | Usability | Application should be used with 2 hours training by administrator  | FR4 |
|  NFR3     | Performance | FR1-2 should complete in < 0.5 sec; FR3-5 should complete in < 3 sec  | All FR |
|  NFR4     | Portability | The application runs on web browsers and Android/iOS smartphones  | All FR |
|  NFR5     | Privacy | Data should be uploaded anonymously | FR1 |

# Use case diagram and use cases

## Use case diagram

```plantuml
left to right direction
actor Administrator as a
actor Customer as b
b -- (FR1 Share current gas station fuel price)
b -- (FR2 Set search filters such as distance and price)
b -- (FR3 Fetch gas stations locations and their current prices satisfying search filters) 
b -- (FR4 Find current location)
a -- (FR5 Review data inserted by customers)
```
## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1 Share current gas station fuel price

| Actors Involved        | Customer |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Gas station S exists, customer C exists |  
|  Post condition     | New data D.price = new_price |
| | D.last_update = curr_time |
| | D.station = S.id |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Customer selectes gas station S, inserts fuel price new_price. curr_time is automatically retrieved from device. Administrator is notified about the new data availability |
|  Variants     |  |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Set search filters such as distance and price 

| Actors Involved        | Customer |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Customer C exists, filter F exists |  
|  Post condition     | F.max_distance = max_distance |
| | F.max_price = max_price |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Customer C inserts max_distance and max_price |
|  Variants     |  |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3 Fetch gas stations locations and their current prices satisfying search filters 

| Actors Involved        | Customer |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Customer C exists, C.location is known, list of gas stations G exists |  
|  Post condition     | New list S contains all gas stations satisfying filters conditions |
|  Nominal Scenario     | The application returns a list containing all gas stations satisfying filters conditions  | 
|  Variants     | If list S is empty, generate a warning suggesting to make filters less strict |

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR4 Find current location

| Actors Involved        | Customer |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Customer C exists |  
|  Post condition     | C.location = curr_location |
|  Nominal Scenario     | The application finds the customer location using GPS data | 
|  Variants     | GPS data is not available, generate an error  |

### Use case 5, FR5 Review data inserted by customers

| Actors Involved        | Administrator  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Administrator A exists, inserted data D exists, gas station S exists (where S.id = D.station) |  
|  Post condition     | If A accepts D: S.price = D.price, S.last_update = D.time else D is discarded  |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Administrator checks data D reliability: if D passes the check, corresponding gas station data
is updated and this new version is made available for all users, otherwise D is discarded |
|  Variants     | |


# Relevant scenarios

## Scenario 1

| Scenario ID: SC1        | Corresponds to UC1, UC5  |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Description | Gas station S data is updated |
| Precondition | Gas station S current price has changed |
| Postcondition |  Gas station price and last update time are updated |
| Step#        |  Step description   |
|  1     | Customer C selects gas station S |  
|  2     | Customer C inserts current fuel price |
|  2     | After being notified administrator checks new data reliability |
|  3     | Accepted data is used to update gas station S data |

## Scenario 2

| Scenario ID: SC2        | Corresponds to UC2, UC3, UC4  |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Description | Customer C searches for a gas station S |
|Precondition | Customer C wants to take fuel |
|Postcondition | Customer C gets the list of available gas stations according to the filters |
| Step#        | Step description  |
|  1     | Customer C sets search filters S |  
|  2     | Customer C location is retrieved |
|  3     | Gas stations are searched for, according to customer location and filters |
|  4     | Customer C gets the list S of corresponing stations |
