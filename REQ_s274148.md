# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:
* collect prices of fuels in different gas stations
* locate gas stations in an area, along with the prices they practice.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Administrator     |Check data correctness| 
| Customer        |They are interested in gas stations data and they generate the data|

## Interfaces
| Actor | Logical Interface | Physical Interface  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
|Administrator|GUI |Screen, keyboard, Internet connection|
|Customer|GUI |Screen, keyboard, Internet connection|


# Stories and personas
Customers need to find the nearest gas station with the lowest price.
Customers help each other sharing prices offered by gas stations they are in.

Administrator wants to check data inserted by customers is reliable, before making it available to other users.

# Scenarios, use case diagram and use cases

# Relevant scenarios

## Scenario 1: Update gas station fuel's price - success

| Scenario ID: SC1        | Corresponds to FR1-2 |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Description | User shares updated data of a gas station |
| Precondition | Gas station S current price has changed |
| Postcondition |  Gas station price and last update time are updated |
| Step#        |  Step description   |
|  1     | Customer C selects gas station S |  
|  2     | Customer C inserts current fuel price |
|  3     | After being notified administrator checks new data reliability |
|  4     | Accepted data is used to update gas station S data |
|  5	 | Updated data is available to all users	|

## Scenario 2: Update gas station fuel's price - fail

| Scenario ID: SC2        | Corresponds to  FR1-2 |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Description | User shares updated data of a gas station |
| Precondition | Gas station S current price has changed |
| Postcondition |  Gas station price and last update time are updated |
| Step#        |  Step description   |
|  1     | Customer C selects gas station S |  
|  2     | Customer C inserts current fuel price |
|  3     | After being notified administrator checks new data reliability |
|  4     | Administrator discards data (possible causes: inconsistency with previous data, wrong data... ) |

## Scenario 3: User looks for a gas station - success

| Scenario ID: SC3        | Corresponds to FR3-6  |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Description | Customer C searches for a gas station S |
|Precondition | Customer C has a device with GPS module |
|Postcondition | Customer C gets the list of available gas stations according to the filters |
| Step#        | Step description  |
|  1     | Customer C sets search filters S |  
|  2     | Customer C location is retrieved |
|  3     | Gas stations are searched for, according to customer location and filters |
|  4     | Customer C gets the list S of corresponing stations |
|  5 	 | The list S is displayed on the map |

## Scenario 4: User looks for a gas station - empty list

| Scenario ID: SC3        | Corresponds to FR3-6 |
| ------------- |:-------------| 
| Description | Customer C searches for a gas station S |
|Precondition | Customer C has a device with GPS module |
|Postcondition | Customer C gets the list of available gas stations according to the filters |
| Step#        | Step description  |
|  1     | Customer C sets search filters S |  
|  2     | Customer C location is retrieved |
|  3     | Gas stations are searched for, according to customer location and filters |
|  4     | The result list S is empty |
|  5 	 | Repeat steps from 1 to 3, changing filters |

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1: SC1-2 Share current gas station fuel price

| Actors Involved        | Customer and administrator |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Gas station S exists, customer C exists |  
|  Post condition     | New data D.price = new_price |
| | D.last_update = curr_time |
| | D.station = S.id |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Customer selectes gas station S, inserts fuel price new_price. curr_time is automatically retrieved from device. Administrator is notified about the new data availability and accept or discard it |
|  Variants     |  |

### Use case 2, UC2: SC3-4 Get list of gas stations

| Actors Involved        | Customer |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Customer C exists |  
|  Post condition     | List S of gas stations |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Customer C inserts filters about distance and price, and the application returns the list of gas stations satisfying the filters, using his current user's position |
|  Variants     |  |
