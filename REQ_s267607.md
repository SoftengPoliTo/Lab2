## Abstract ##
A group of bikers have the issue of knowing the fuel prices on the different location they are or they want to visit, they decide to create a crowdsourcing application where user can share the price of fuels of gas station. 

The users can view the fuel prices of the different registered station on a map. 

A user can choose to sign up on the platform, an authenticated user can ask for inserting a new gas station providing latitude and longitute, the prices and an image that documents the existance of the station, he can update the fuel prices of a registered station selecting it from the map and he can also send messages to the administrators, for example alerting that a station does not exists anymore.

The bikers select one or more person to become administrators of the platform. Administrators can remove the visibility of a station on the map, they can insert a new station when the user send the request for a new one and they can invalidate the login of a user.

They choose to create the application as a web platform.
