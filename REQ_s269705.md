# Abstract

It is usually difficult for a driver to find a gas station near them when the tank is running low on fuel, and it's even worse if they want to save money choosing a station that offers a good deal. And, to add insult to injury, right after filling up the tank, they find another gas station with a much lower price.

EZGas is a service that provides a simple and complete preview of the gas stations near the user, as well as the prices of their fuel.


# Stakeholders

| User | Uses the system to locate the nearest and cheapest gas station |
| Gas station owner | Doesn't use directly the application, provides its fuel prices |
| Map service | Provides maps and related functionalities |
| Administrator | Manages and supervises the system |

# Stories and personas

- Tom travels in a lot of different cities, and he needs to know the position of nearby gas stations without roaming around or asking for directions every few minutes
- Jennifer is a commuter, and every day takes a long drive to go to work. She knows the gas stations near her usual route, but the prices are always changing and she always wonders where to stop to have the best deal.
- Any Gas is a large company, and it wants to be as easily available as possible. Its brand is easily recognizable, but drivers may not be aware of branches in less crowded areas of their cities
- Shelf is a family business and they usually offer competitive prices, but only loyal customers are aware of it. Due to this, a lot of people don't stop at their gas station simply because they're unaware of it.
