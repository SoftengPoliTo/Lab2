# Stories and personas

Lorenzo is a sales agent. He drives for miles every day, so he needs to stop several times during his working hours in order to refuel his car. Lorenzo understood that it was a good idea to take note of the best pricing gas stations in order to remember them for the next time. Day by day he noticed that the prices were not fixed so he thought that it could be useful to have a community of people keeping track of the prices all over the country. Lorenzo created a forum in order to share his notes about the prices and the places where he was used to refuel. 

Giovanni is a truck driver. He discovered the forum created by Lorenzo and he considered that it could be useful for his long trips. Since he didn’t have time to write on the forum in order to update the prices, he decided not to sign up to it.

Maurizio is a gas station owner. He noticed that his earnings were not so satisfying so he decided to lower his prices. The problem was that, in order to increase his income, he needed expensive sponsorships and he would know a cheaper way to gain visibility.
