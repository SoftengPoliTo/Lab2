# Stories and personas

Chris is going to the sea in a beautiful day with his family: Rihanna, his wife, Jack and Russell, his sons. 

During the trip, the gas tank is almost empty, then Chris takes his phone and he starts to use EZGas App, which shows to him the nearest gas station. 

Without this app, Chris would have been in a critical situation, because he needs the gas for his car when the tank is empty.

Yet fortunately Chris has the EZGas App, and his trip continues without problems.

Dave has been a waiter, and after three years when he earned money, he decides to buy a gas station. He uploads his gas station on the EZGas App and set the gas price, in this way, all the people know where his station is located. When the price of the gas changes, Dave updates his gas station price.

Dave is clever, and doing this he can earn more money, because gas station has more visibility.
