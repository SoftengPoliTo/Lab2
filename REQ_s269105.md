# Abstract
Drivers look for gas stations closest to them looking at the prices of the various gas stations in order of proximity. Drivers can check the prices of their favorite gas station.

The various operators of gas stations can register a new gas station with the prices, they can also make special discounts.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Gas Station Operator   |Uses the application for register gas stations, prices and special discounts| 
| Driver       |Uses the application in guest mode or log in in the personal area for search gas stations, look their prices and save eventualy favorite gas station (only for registered account)|

# Stories and personas

Gianni is a driver who travels a lot for work. He travels for km and km, so the price of gasoline is important to him, because unfortunately the reimbursement given by his company is very limited.
Each time he stops at the first petrol station, not knowing that maybe there is another cheaper petrol station ahead.

Alfred is a gas station operator of a little gas station. Since the big companies came to town, things have gone wrong for him.
Every time he tries to make the best price, but nobody ever goes there because he have the last petrol station of a one-way street.

Gianni and Alfred will never meet if there was no application that tells Gianni that Alfred's price is the best.
