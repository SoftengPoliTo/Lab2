# Abstract

EZGas is a crowdsourcing service that allows users to:

* Perform searches for gas stations in their area by selecting the interested fuel type. The search can be based on the price of fuel or on the distance to reach the gas stations;
* Report a new price of a certain type of fuel in a gas station;
* Report a new gas station not already available in EZGas.

EZGas is supported by a web application (accessible both via smartphone or PC).
The gas stations are localized thanks to a specific API of Google Maps.

In order to be able to use the application, users must set up a (free) EZGas account and be logged in.
He must also activate the GPS position on their smartphone.

# Stakeholders


| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Developer | Develops the application and checks periodically for possible raising issues. |
| Administrator | Works closely with the application developer to tune and troubleshoot the application. Leads and participates in efforts to implement application updates to include upgrades, patches, and new releases with the goal of meeting the end users' needs. He is fully responsible for daily monitoring and maintanance activities (monitors and, if necessary, can ban users, stop hackers, fix accounts). | 
| User | Uses the application directly, because he is interesting in finding the closest gas stations (or the most convenient one) and in keeping prices up to date. |
| GoogleMaps | Provides an Application Program Interface (API) to the application, so that gas stations can be easily localized. |

# Stories and personas

Alice, Susan and Ally are a group of friends that love to travel by car. Since they visit new places, one of the challenges they face during their trips is finding gas stations to refill their car when they are running low on fuel. They've often had to ask the local people for information for the nearest gas stations. They would like to have a simpler way of locating gas stations with respect to their position.

Larry is a truck driver.
Everyday he travels long distances through areas that most of the time he is not familiar with. It would be very useful for him to know where gas stations near him are located when he needs to refill, especially the most convenient one.

Abigail has always believed that knowledge is power.
Thatâ€™s why when she sees an offer, she thinks everyone should know about it. She works an hour from home and knows first-hand how expensive fuel can be as she relies on her car to get her there. For this reason, when she comes across a gas station with good fuel prices, she would love to be able to share this information with whoever could benefit from it.

Sara is a nature lover. In order to avoid polluting, she has bought an electric car.
However it can be difficult for her to find gas stations that allow her to charge the battery. She recently found one, and noted it down to share this information with those friends of hers which also have an electric car. 
Sara would like to have a simple way of locating the nearest gas stations that recharges electrical cars, and share this information with others.

John is the administrator of EzGas. Aside from working on application updates and fixing possible bugs, he is responsible for the daily monitoring of users.
