# Abstract

Some *customers* volunteer to report prices of fuels in different gas stations where they transit when they refuel.  
Customers can be registered and unregistered 

For gas stations for which no data is collected during the last 24 hours the reporting activity may be carried out by *empoyees* of the Gas station itself by sending them a notification. 
To report the data to the administrator customers and employees can both use a telegram channel/ mail which can be found on the site of the crowdsourcing company.

One *administrator* of the crowdsourcing EZGas service is collecting and joining all these data in an excel sheet. Possibly as the number of gas stations to manage increases the number of administrators may increase as well in order to efficiently manage  the service over time.
In the same excel sheet together with fuel prices are collected the loactions of the Gas stations.
