# Stories and personas
John has to drive to an appointment by car but he is running low on gas. Since he is already late he needs a fuel
station that is as near as possible to his home. He uses the mobile versione of EZGas to look for all the fuel
stations around him and finds the closest one.

Tom uses the car very often so to save some money he prefers to find a ceaper fuel station even if it means
driving a little further. So when he uses EZGas he orders his search based on the prize of the fuel offered by
the different stations. But when he reaches the fuel station he had chosen he realizes that the prizes have been
increased. In order to inform the other users he immediatly goes on EZGas to update the fuel prizes.
On his mamy trips Tom also keeps an eye on possible new fuel stations. Whenever he finds a new one or simply one
that hasn't been inserted on EZGas yet, he tries to insert the new stations as soon as possible, even though
sometimes he isn't able to remeber the prizes. But another user may insert them later on.
