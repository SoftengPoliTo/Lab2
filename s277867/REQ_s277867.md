# Abstract

Anyone who owns a non-electric car needs to refuel his vehicle over time. Sometimes you know where you are goning to refuels, sometimes you don't. If you're travelling a long distance it will happen that you need to find a gas station, and probably you want to find the cheapest near. Maybe you want to find the cheapest near you house to stop arguing with your partner about where to go refueling. EZGas is an application that provides user with location and prices of gas stations and shows them on a map.

# Stories and personas

Mr. RandomUser is travelling with his daughter RandomDaughter around Italy using his beautiful car. After 467 Km on the highway he wants to rest a little and refuel his car, so he asks his daughter to take his phone and check on EZGas app the cheapest gas station in no more than 60 km, the apps shows a map with a pin for all the gas station and RandomDaughter sets the maximum distance to 60 km, then she proceeds to check the prices of the gas stations shown on the map.

Mr. RegisteredUser notices that the prices in his favourite gas station are changed, but that change is not yet recorded in the EzGas app, so he wants to modify the saved prices by clicking on the gas station pin and selecting “update prices” then proceeds typing the new import.

Mr. RegisteredUser wants to register a gas station. In the app menu he clicks on register a gas station and after compiling the form he can select the position on the map. 

Mr RegistereUsers is in a different city with is car, he checks on the EZGas app where to find a cheap gas station, but the one he finds is not really existing, so he clicks on the "not existing" button in the gas station page. Then proceeds to check fon another one near.
