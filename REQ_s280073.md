# Abstract

Some people like to know which gas station has the best prices of fuel in the area to save some money. 
A person, called *developer*, creates a platform (a browser application) called "EZGas"in order to allow people from all over to insert prices and be able to share them with others. So each person that finds a new gas station in an area, can go to the application EZGas and inserts the new data discovered. 

To do so each person must create a profile on the app and, after the log in operation, will be able to perform an insertion or a search in the area.
If someone discovers that some prices are wrong can report this issue to the app and the *App administrator* will be able to intervene and solve the problem by allowing the insertion of the new prices by means of the modification of the previous ones.
Whenever this operation is done the person can log out.


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Administrator     |Manages profiles on the app, and enables people to modify prices in case of errors| 
| Developer         |Doesn't use the application directly. He just creates a platform in which people can share their findings regarding prices| 
| Map API      |Third party server used to implement the map on the application so that people can locate gas stations easily| 
| User              |Use the application directly. They are interested in finding gas station and share the new ones they find in the platform|

# Stories and personas
Jack is a father of 2, each morning drives the kids to school and then goes to work. Every week on Saturday goes to the gas station to fill the tank, but he notices that his usual gas station has increased the price. Since the situation at work is not the best he tries to find a cheaper station so he goes on the app EZGas, creates a profile, and search for the best price station in the area of his work place. 

Alice is a bank officer, a quite wealthy one. She usually does the same route to work every morning, but today her usual gas station has close due to repairs. She wants to find the closest station to fill her tank, regardless of the price. To do so uses the app EZGas. After that she goes to work happy because she saved a lot of time and came into work before her shift.

Maja is a police officer and is very diligent towards precision and correctness in documents. She usually drives to the local gas station to fill her car, but looking at the app that uses she notices that the prices are not correct. Following her usual thoughts in this cases, she reports that the prices are incorrect and after the enabling of the operation from the administrator of the platform she modifies and correct the prices.

Robert is the administrator of the platform. Every day at the office he must check whether the users of the platform perform in conformance to the requirements that the developer has set. This means that prices inserted are inside a specific range, must check wheather someone tries to access the platform without an active account and must enable people that report an error in prices.

Jackson is the owner of a gas station. He is struggling in the last period since he opened a new station and doesn't have a lot of clients since people don't know where it is. One of his friends uses frequently the app EZGas and tells it to Jackson to help him with his job. Jackson, after creating an account, inserts his new gas station onto the application map and inserts all his fuel prices. He notices that his price was lower than the ones in the area and in the next few days a lot of clients go to him to fill their tanks.
