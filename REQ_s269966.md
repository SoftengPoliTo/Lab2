# Abstract

The web-based app is implemented to manipulate the GAS station for the Users to provide the best location of the gas station in terms of location and price. When the user starts finding the nearest location of a gas station by the cellphone or web Browser the APP retrieves data from a MAP API system providing the map, route, and distance to the GAS based on the current location of the User. 

The user also has the chance to create a profile to interact with the APP by providing some information to update the prices of the gas station. Regular users can also use the APP, however, they can not add a new station or request an update for the price. The acceptance of user requests in the system would be under the control of the Administrator.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Administrator     |Control the data Flow, check the data sending by the users| 
| User          |Use the system directly with their cellphones to find the gas station| 
| MAP API    	    |Provide suitable data for the users to find the nearest Gas Satation or Lowest Price |

# Stories and personas

Joseph is an active and industrious teacher and program developer who always try to manage their time as best as possible. He has an impressive time scheduling for himself to get to work timely. He tries to follow this personal time management, but he often suffers from finding the nearest Gas Station. He wasted a huge amount of time to get the station and most of the time he is not able to find the right path to the station. Besides, he wants to save his money by searching the cheapest location of GAS station nearby.
Goals: wants a system to find a suitable location (in terms of distances and prices) of the station to reach, as well as offer the cheapest one to others. 

He would like to have an application to locate the nearest Gas station around by using his cell phone and also by his computer. He wants to implement a very simple but practical application, which easy to use for all users.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1  Demonstrate the nearest location

| Actors Involved        | User , MAP API  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|Precondition | The app runs, User Location (CL) exists, GAS Location (GL) exists|    
|Postcondition| Demonstrate the Route to the User, calculate the distances and show it on the MAP|
|Nominal Scenario| User selects Gas Station, base on the current location of the User, calculate and demonstrate the nearest station to the User on the MAP provided by API |
|  Variants     | User does not turn the GPS on, the Internet connection is not available |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Receive the price

| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | User Account CA exists, LOG in to the system|  
|  Postcondition     | The price of specific station stores in the system |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User log into the account successfully, the app performs the authentication, User select the specific station and send the price of it |
|  Variants     | User is not able to log in, the account of the user is banned by the admin, User does not create the account |
