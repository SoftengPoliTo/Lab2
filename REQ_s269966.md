# Abstract

One of the main issues of the major cities and the big one, is finding the best and less crowded Gas Station. which people always try to find this kind of place to do their task as soon as posible. So, an online system is required in this way to service people to find the Gas station soon and find the location of it in its cell phone and other E-devices by using the GPS system easily. Additionally, it is necessary to collect the fuel price in the different gas locations to make the right decision.


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Owner             |Control the data Flow, check the data sending by the users| 
| Customer        |Use the system directly with their cell phones or other electronic devices to find the gas station| 
| MAP API    	|Provide suitable data for the users to find the nearest Gas Satation or Lowest Price |

# Stories and personas

Joseph is an active and industrious teacher and program developer who always try to manage their time as best as possible. He has an impressive time scheduling for himself to get to work timely. Despite this kind of personal time management. He always suffers from finding the right Gas Station to get his car full. He wasted a huge amount of time to get the less-crowded station and most of the time he got stuck in the long queue for doing his task.
Goals: wants a system to find the best location (in terms of distances and prices) of the station to reach as well as realize the price of gas in each station easily. 

He would like to have an Application to locate the nearest Gas station around by using his cell phone as well as computer. He wants to implement a very simple but practical applcation, which easy to use for all people regardress of ages.

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1  Demonstrate the nearest location of GAS station

| Actors Involved        | customer , MAP API |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Customer Location (CL) exists, GAS location exists (GL) |     
|  Postcondition     | Demonstrate the Route to the Customer, calculate the distances and show it on the MAP|
|  Nominal Scenario     | Customer select Gas Station, base on the current location of the customer, calculate and demonstrate the nearest station to the customer |
|  Variants     |  |

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Record selected GAS stations in the customer's account

| Actors Involved        | customer , MAP API |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | customer account CA exists, MAP the GAS station GL exists|  
|  Post condition     | the selected station add to the list of stations in customer account |
|  Nominal Scenario     | customer log into the account successfully, the app performe the authentication, customer select the specific station and add it into list |
|  Variants     |  |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR7 Manage the customer and owner's Account by authenticating and providing the control panel

| Actors Involved        | Owner , Customer |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | customer account (CA) exists, owner account (OA) exists, issue the permission |  
|  Postcondition     | customer and owner can do their tasks in their panel |
|  Nominal Scenario     | customer or owner use their username and password to access the profile if the system authorized and authenticate them successfully, use their panel |
|  Variants     | The application shows an error message  |

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR4 Show the list of station based on lowest price

| Actors Involved        | customer, API MAP |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Filter Option (FO) exists, API exits, List Station (LA) exists|  
|  Postcondition     | LA.filter(FO) < LA |
|  Nominal Scenario     | the customer use the filter option, and base of the price selected, the app provides the list of station|
|  Variants     | the total list demonstrate |
