# Abstract

Buying fuel at the lowest price possible is a task which every money conscious motorist has to perform often. Searching for the station practicing the lowest prices is not always simple, as it requires to check on each respective website just before refueling.
EZGas, putting in practice the concept of crowd-sourcing, offers a simple inteface that shows the user prices practiced in nearby stations and lets him upload updated informations.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| User		    |Uses the application to check prices, shares up to date prices and marks currently show prices as correct.
| Administrator	    |Checks that the service works correctly, taking actions in case a user inputs erroneous data intentionally.

# Stories and personas

Mark, 40 years old, has a full-time job at a tires factory; he works from Monday to Friday for 8 hours a day. On a typical day, Mark exits the factory at 5.10 pm and usually refuels his car on his trip back to home, as in the morning he has little time and he likes to spend the evening home. Mark lives 30 minutes away from his workplace and on his trip, there are 4 gas stations, each one of a different brand and distant from one another. Prior to knowing of EZgas he usually ended up buying gas at the last station on his trip back home, in the hope that was the most economical, and often his hopes weren't realised. EZgas let him save close to 500$ this past year.

Jared, 18 years old, just had his car bought as a present from his wealthy parents. He goes to high school, doesn't study a lot and his professors report that he doesn't behave well towards his classmates. Jared recently got to know about EZgas app from one of his classmates and decided to download it on his phone to mess up the system by uploading wrong data. A lot of motorists soon found discrepancies between the data on the app and the real world and managed to upload correct info. In the same week, the Administrator of the EZgas, reviewing the usage statistics, noticed that almost all the changes made by Jared were marked as incorrect in a 6 hour timespan, so decided to ban his account, having the suspicion it was a troll account.

# System Design
This UML class diagrams shows the main components of the system. The personal computer is used by the administrator to access the server. The server stores and retrieves data from a database DB, makes use of a map service to calculate distances, locate GSs, provides the service to users via website or Android App.
