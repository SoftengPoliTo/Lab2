# Abstract

Everyday people get into their cars and drive either to go to work, on vacation or simply to meet up with some friends.
As the time passes the fuel level of their tanks gets lower and lower until they find themselves stopping for gas at the first gas station they can spot and paying a lot more money than they would have had to if only they had known that a couple of kilometers ahead there were another gas station with a lower fuel price.

Thanks to EZGas this won't be a problem anymore.

EZGas is an application providing a crowdsourcing service to allow users to collect the prices of fuels in the different gas stations and to locate the gas stations in a specific area along with the prices they practice.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder Name | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| Users            | Use the application to locate on a map the nearest gas stations to their area of interest and their fuel prices. They can also insert new gas stations and update the prices of others |
| Administrator | Doesn't use directly the application itself but manages the users checking their modifications to the list of gas stations and prices and handling any possible errors | 
| Map Provider  |  Grants the application the permission to use its maps to locate the different gas stations on |

# Stories And Personas

Linus is a commuter who spends a lot of his time during the days inside his car either travelling to work or just moving around the city to perform everyday chores.Besides, he has a strong sense of respect for the work of others and he is very proactive.

As a consequence, Linus spends a relevant amount of his salary in gas and he would reall like to reduce it to dedicate part of it for other purposes.

Therefore, Linus would appreciate a simple way to use his smartphone to always look up the best fuel prices available among the gas stations near to him as he travels in order to save some money and also never have to be worried about the possibility of going out of gas.
Moreover, he would also be really happy to share the location of the best spots he  already found to refuel after years of travelling through the same zones.

Bob owns a gas station in an area that is not very known unfortunately and he would like to increase the amount of customers he receives.
Therefore Bob would like to have an easy way to signal the position of his gas station on the map along with the fuel prices he practices that he knows are very competitive compared to the competiton since he already had already lowered them a bit hoping that would help with the whole customer situation too.

Lucy is an average person who travels a lot by car too and would absolutely love to have the possibility to reduce her expenses on something she needs to buy very often such as gas for her car but she has also always been very skeptical about the whole online identity matter because of the possible risks related to her privacy involved with having one. So she would like a way to gain access to a service like the one Linus desires but without needing expose her personal data in any way.
