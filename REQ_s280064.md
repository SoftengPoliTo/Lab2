# Abstract

Currently there is no way to compare prices of fuel in a reliable, easy and interoperable way between mobile and desktop devices.
The solutions that are already there, more often than not, have poor reviews due to their out of date fuel prices or only work in certain countries or regions of the world.
This can seem unavoidable, due to the sheer scale of the problem at hand.

EZGas proposes to change this, thanks to a crowdsourcing model where both motor vehicle owners and gas station managers update prices of the fuel at gas stations themselves.


# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| User    	 | Uses the web application in order to find the cheapest fuel prices in his proximity and/or update the prices when they differ from the actual ones |
| Administrator  | Manages users, user reports and other data related to gas stations and prices |
| Google Maps        | Service used by the application to locate and display gas stations close to the users |

# Stories and personas
Micheal is a student worker who does not earn much money in his part-time job. 
He has a really tight budget due to his daily expenses and can barely afford a car as is.
He would really love to shop for cheaper gasoline for his car, but cannot find a service with up to date prices.

Vivian is the manager of a small independent gas station with some of the best prices in her part of town. However, many motor vehicle owners are not even aware of its existence as they are used to buying fuel at flashier and well established chains. She doesn't know how to attract customers without spending a fortune in an advertising campaign.

# Functional and non functional requirements

## Functional Requirements

|  FR2     | Check prices of fuel in various gas stations |
|  FR3     | Authorize and authenticate |
|  FR3.1     | Log in |
|  FR3.2     | Log out |
|  FR3.3     | Create new a account |
|  FR4     | Report inaccurate fuel prices |
|  FR5 | Manage users and data |
|  FR5.1 | Ban fraudulent users |
|  FR5.2 | Remove suspicious prices |

## Non Functional Requirements

| ID        | Type (efficiency, reliability, .. see iso 9126)           | Description  | Refers to |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:| -----:|
|  NFR1     | Usability | The web application should be used with no training | All FR except FR5|
|  NFR2     | Performance | All functions should complete in < 0.5 sec  | All FR |
|  NFR3     | Portability | The web application should run on the most used browsers, on all major desktop and mobile operating systems   | All FR |
|  NFR4     | Localization | Decimal numbers use . (dot) as decimal separator ||
|  NFR5     | Localization | Prices are to be displayed as "per liter" or "per gallon" depending on the region of the user ||
|  NFR6     | Efficiency | The user should be able to sort gas stations by distance and price |FR2|
|  NFR7     | Efficiency | Given the fuel consumption of the motor vehicle to be filled and the amount of fuel desired (or the amount of money the user is going to spend to fill the motor vehicle), the web application should be able to sort gas stations by most cost-effective considering fuel cost at the gas station, fuel consumption of the motor vehicle and distance between the user and the gas station |FR2|

## Use Cases

### Use case 1, UC1 - FR1  Record fuel prices for a given gas station

| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | User is registered, logged in, and visited gas station GS for which they are recording the new price for a fuel type |  
|  Postcondition     | For all updated fuel types: GS.\<fuel_name\>.post_price != GS.\<fuel_name\>.pre_price|
|  Nominal Scenario     | User selects gas station GS from the provided map or list, then selects the type of fuel whose price they want to update and provides the new price, if it is different from the previously recorded one|
|  Variants     | User provides price that doesn't match the real price. The web application will rely on another user reporting this incorrect price. <br/>User is banned from contributing. In this case, they are presented with a warning message that states that they are not allowed to complete this operation.|

### Use case 2, UC2 - FR2 Check prices of fuel in various gas stations

| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition         | User is registered and logged in|  
|  Postcondition       |  |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User selects the type of fuel they need and they are presented with a map and a list of gas stations near them |
|  Variants             | User doesn't have the GPS enabled on their device. They are presented with the option to turn it on or provide their zip code as an alternative way of locating the nearest gas stations.  |

### Use case 3, UC3 - FR3 Authorize and authenticate

| Actors Involved        | User, Administrator |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     |  |  
|  Postcondition     | User/Administrator logged in, logged out or new user personal account created |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User/Administrator wants to use one of the functions of the web application, so they are requested to register or login.<br/>User/Administrator independently decides to register or log in.<br/> User/Administrator wants to log out of the web application.|
|  Variants     | User/Administrator fails to register or log in because of missing/incorrect/incoherent data in the form. In this case they are presented again with the same form, with their data filled as it was, and with an error message explaining what is the issue. |

### Use case 4, UC4 - FR4 Report inaccurate fuel prices

| Actors Involved        | User |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | There is a price P related to a fuel type F in a gas station GS that is perceived by the user as suspiciously out of line with the prices at that gas station|  
|  Postcondition     | Report sent to the Administrator for further consideration |
|| User thanked for their contribution and asked to continue as specified in UC1 |
|  Nominal Scenario     | User notices a suspicious price on the web application, that they think does not make sense or is clearly fraudulent. They press the report button next to the price and provide the correct one following the procedure specified in UC1|
|  Variants     | User does not want to (or cannot) enter a new price. In this case the previous price is neither removed nor replaced, but it is publicly marked as suspicious on the web application, until the administrator takes further steps. |

### Use case 5, UC5 - FR5 Manage users and data

| Actors Involved        | Administrator  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
|  Precondition     | Administrator logged in |  
|  Postcondition     |  |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Administrator can add, remove or ban users, inspect reports and take the necessary actions or view gas stations with their fuels and relative prices. |
|  Variants     | |
