### Personas and stories

John owns since some month a gas station which he opened in small city which is often traversed by a lot of people travelling (most for work). He wants to spread informations about its station and its convenient prices such that many of these, while going to work, stop there to refill their vehicles. 

At the moment, since it is on a very small road, only few of them end up there, even if he tried to put some advertisement throughout the city. 

He wants to be able to increase the awareness of its station among this possible customers. This can be done by the mean of the EZGas application which he would directly use to publish and advertise its work.

---

Bob is a plumber since many years; he tries to cover a very big area in order to reach as many customers as possible. This means that he often has to travel a lot through the country, resulting in considerable expenses due to fuel for his old furgon. 

He often ends up traveling in cities which he doesn't really know while requiring to refill its vehicle, which means he often stops at the first station which he sees on the road. 

Bob wants to be able to access the must suitable stations every time he needs, most of all when he is in a city which he doesn't know much about; this would be achieved with the EZGas application, which would be able to provide the nearest stations with their relative prices.

---

Alice likes contributing to services to help people, even in small things. She actually writes on Google a lot of reviews for places where she's been.

She lives since decades along with her family in a city which she knows very well, and from many of her new collegues she receives questions about which are the best and/or the most convenient places for doing something and she explains them where they are, but at the same time she feels that many other people cannot receive these informations. 

She wants to be able to spread all of these informations more easily among the people transferring to her city; with EZGas she would have a platform for publishing all the informations about the gas stations of the city along with their prices and eventually verify the correct ones, helping the newcomers find what they need.
