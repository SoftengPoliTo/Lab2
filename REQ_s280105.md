# Abstract

EZGas is a smartphone application useful for constantly now where is the nearest and cheapest Gas Station near your position.

It is fully updatable by registered users: they can add new Gas Station and their prices if not already in the application and also update the pre-existing prices.

All this operations are monitored and accepted or refused by a local Administrator, who is in charge of the reliability of few Gas Stations and the correctness of their prices.

Registered users are free to leave a useful review of the Gas Station for other users, and also to report some errors or inconsistencies of the data to the Administrator.

# Stakeholders

| Stakeholder name  | Description | 
| ----------------- |:-----------:|
| Administrator     | Manages locations and prices of different gas stations in a specific area, in order to verify that are valid values. He also populates the area at the beginning with some gas stations and their prices. | 
| User              | Use the application directly, only to receive information about gas station, their prices and eventually their reviews. |
| Registered user   | Use the application directly. Can add a gas station and its prices, modify them and can also leave a review of the service. Finally, he can also report an inconsistency to the Administrator |

# Stories and personas
Michael has to move a lot for work, from city to city, and as long as he has to respect some time schedule, he prefers to move with his own car. However, he founds frustrating that each time the prices of different gas stations are so different and therefore a long trip could be very expensive.

Michael would like to have a simple way to find which gas station has the best prices according to the road that he has to follow.

Jim is a truck driver who drives mostly in the night. When he has to take a new route, most of the times he doesn't know how many kilometers he can still travel before the next gas station.

In addition, Jim finds useful to know in which gas station he can have a sleep break and maybe something to eat, so a feedback from other users (specially other truck drivers) could be very useful.

|  Post condition     | This GS has now a list of P for fuel type |
|  Nominal Scenario     | Registered user selects a GS on map and adds P for each fuel type |
