# Stories and Personas

- Paul is an occasional user that do not use so much his car. Anyway, between his house and his job there are some gas stations. Paul uses the application to find the cheaper fuel distributor.

- Eric is a home seller and he trales quite a lot to go to his customers' houses. He uses EzGas to find the best station depending on his location. Eric is also a lazy person that does not want to put any effort in keeping updated the application, indeed he uses EzGas as a Guest.

- Anna works ina an office in about 15 km from her house. She is a very finicky person that loves order and numbers. She also loves save money, so every day updates gas station prices that she meets.

- Rob is a trucker that loves to be useful to other people. During his job break, Rob updates gas station prices so that other people can save money.

- Rob and Anna signal to an admin when they occour in clear incoherent information, like a station signed as dismissed while is still opened. They also add new stations or update them when there are new kind of fuels available.

- John is a dishonest station owner. Sometimes he raises gas prices of other stations in order to have a moajor income to his station.

- Alex is an administrator of EzGas. He is in charge of delete dismissed stations and to get rid of bad users. He has access to all updates performed by each user in the last 6 Months. 

- Anna notice that John often updates gas stations with fake information. After a while, Anna signals to the system John. Alex will receive the signalation and if reasons provided by Anna are coherent with John's logs, then he will be banned.
